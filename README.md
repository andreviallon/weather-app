# React Weather App

See the app running live at https://jovial-williams-ca9530.netlify.app/

## What I Learned

* React (functional components / React Hooks)
* State Management with React's context API
* Navigation with React Router
* Working with 3rd party libraries (Chartjs, Moment, Clock and Axios)
* Deploy to Netlify

## Use Case Senarios
The uers should be able to...

* See an overview of the current weather
* See a detailed forecast for today (humidity level, sunset/sunrise, temperature for the next 48 hours)
* See an overview for the next week's forecast

## Ideas for improvment

* Give the user ability to select different cities
* See the local time at the selected city
