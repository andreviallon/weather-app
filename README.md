# React Weather App

## What I Learned

* React (functional components / React Hooks)
* State Management with React's context API

## Use Case Senarios
The uers should be able to...

* See an overview of the current weather
* See a detailed forecast for today (humidity level, sunset/sunrise, temperature for the next 48 hours)
* See an overview for the next week's forecast

## Ideas for improvment

* Give the user ability to select different cities
* See the local time at the selected city
